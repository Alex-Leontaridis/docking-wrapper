Docking Wrapper: Issues I Found While Testing

Critical Bugs
    1    Protein PDBQT Conversion is Broken
Fallback PDB-to-PDBQT prep creates invalid atom types like +0.000 N which crashes Vina. Needs to use proper AutoDock formatting or fix the MGLTools setup.
    2    Results Parsing Crashes
parser is referenced but never defined. So even when docking works (like with GNINA), results can’t be parsed. Either implement the parser or remove the broken reference.

Major Issues
3.⁠ ⁠MGLTools Path is Hardcoded
It expects MGLTools at a fixed Mac path and fails silently when it’s not there. Needs to be configurable or replaced with something that works across systems.
 4 No Error Handling in Docking Steps
If anything breaks (e.g., bad inputs to Vina), the pipeline just keeps going and then fails later. Needs early exits when prep or docking fails.

Minor/Polish
5.⁠ ⁠Deprecation Warnings from Meeko — still using old .setup() and .write_pdbqt_string().
6.⁠ ⁠Missing Dependencies Not Caught Early — sklearn wasn't installed and the error wasn’t clear.
7.⁠ ⁠DiffDock Dummy Detection is Weak — dummy mode throws misleading errors.

Structural Problems
8.⁠ ⁠Hardcoded Paths Everywhere — MGLTools, binaries, outputs, etc. Not portable.
9.⁠ ⁠Inconsistent Logging — errors look totally different across modules.
